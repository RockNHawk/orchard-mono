orchard-mono
============

Files (patches, setup) to patch Orchard CMS (windows .net) for Mono .net Linux environment

Until otherwise noted, the patches to source have one hardcoded path reference (which I will correct soon),
for now the install must be in form

/var/orchard/src

/var/orchard/src/Orchard.Web

layout.
